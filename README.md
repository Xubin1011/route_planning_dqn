Constrained Route Planning of Electric Vehicles  with Recharging Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning

When using EVs for long-distance travel, drivers must make decisions based on available information of charging stations and the current State of Charge (SoC) to select an appropriate charging station. Nevertheless, both detouring to a charging station and the time required for recharging will extend the travel duration. Additionally, making an incorrect choice can potentially lead to being stranded due to insufficient energy supply. Therefore, the judicious selection of the optimal charging opportunities becomes important. Furthermore, during extended journeys, drivers must also ensure they obtain sufficient rest to guarantee safe driving, which is a crucial aspect addressed in this project.

In this project, we propose a charging decision model for electric vehicles that can be applied to long-distance travel. The goal is to make charging decisions and rest decisions that minimize travel time without violating any constraints.
